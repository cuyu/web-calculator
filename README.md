A web calculator using React.

Each code branch maps a method to manage states of React components:

- *master*: using global variable;
- *with-flux*: using React original `flux` lib;
- *with-redux*: using original `redux` lib;
- *with-react-redux*: using the `react-redux` lib besides of `redux`;

Also, I will use git tags to label progress on each branch so that we can easily find the same progress using different methods.
